## Build instructions

You need to download these libraries yourself and place their source files to the following directories. They are required for any platform.

| library | files | destination |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [LodePNG](https://github.com/lvandeve/lodepng) | `lodepng.h` and `lodepng.c` | `source/lodepng/` |
| [cglm](https://github.com/recp/cglm) | `include/cglm/` | `source/cglm/` |
| [cNBT](https://github.com/chmod222/cNBT) | `buffer.c`, `buffer.h`, `list.h`, `nbt_loading.c`, `nbt_parsing.c`, `nbt_treeops.c`, `nbt_util.c` and `nbt.h` | `source/cNBT/` |
| [parson](https://github.com/kgabis/parson) | `parson.h` and `parson.c` | `source/parson/` |
| [M*LIB](https://github.com/P-p-H-d/mlib) | any root `*.h` | compiler include path |

### Wii

For the Wii platform you need to install the [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) Wii/Gamecube environment. Additionally install zlib using pacman of devkitPro.

```bash
dkp-pacman -S wii-dev ppc-zlib
```

To build, simply run make in the root directory. You might need to load the cross compiler env first (required e.g. if you use [fish](https://fishshell.com/) instead of bash).

```bash
source /etc/profile.d/devkit-env.sh
make
```

There should then be a .dol file in the root directory that your Wii can run. To copy the game to your `apps/` folder, it needs to look like this:
```
cavex
├── assets
│   ├── terrain.png
│   ├── items.png
│   ├── anim.png
│   ├── default.png
│   ├── gui.png
│   └── gui2.png
├── saves
│   ├── world
│   └── ...
├── boot.dol
├── config.json
├── icon.png
└── meta.xml
```

### GNU/Linux

The game can also run on any PC with support for OpenGL 2.0 and played with keyboard and mouse.

Building requires the following additional libraries, which you can install with your system package manager: `zlib`, `glfw3` and `glew`. You can then use CMake and gcc to build. The already existing Makefile is for the Wii platform only and might be removed sometime later.

```bash
mkdir build_pc
cd build_pc
cmake ..
make
```

Please also copy the fragment and vertex shaders from `resources/` next to your `assets/` directory.
